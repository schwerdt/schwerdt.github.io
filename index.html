<p> Hello!  My name is Christine Schwerdtfeger.  I have several years experience  programming
in other languages, and I decided earlier this year to embark on a new adventure coding
in Python.  Compared to the other languages I have used, Python is very nice for text
manipluation.  Dictionaries are another nice feature of Python that I have enjoyed
using.  </p>

<p># Medallion Hunting
<br>I am starting this page with my Prairie Fest Medallion Hunting code.  I am not yet sure
what will be next!  The code can be found in the PrairieFestMedallionHunt repository.  
Leading up to an annual summer festival in town, there is
a medallion hunt.  Each week, a clue is released by the park district.  Your job is to figure out where the clue
is sending you.  If you go to the right place, you will find a paper with some numbers on it
that will be useful in determining the location of the medallion.  We found some of the
numbers.  The last clue indicated that the numbers could be decoded using the telephone
keypad.  Because we did not have the complete set of numbers, I wrote a code to take the
numbers we did have and determine which parks were possible matches.  
There is a README file there that provides some background on the code, which you can find at:

<p># Testing out Search Methods
<br>I was reading about search and decided to test out some different measures of similarity
by writing a very simple search code.  There is a README file in this repository:
<br/>
<A HREF="https://github.com/schwerdt/TakingSearchForASpin">https://github.com/schwerdt/TakingSearchForASpin</A>
<br/>
that has information about how to run it and add articles to the set of articles that is searched. 
I plan to work on improving the search method and the sources that are searched but wanted to 
share what I have so far!  Hope you have fun if you decide to take this search method for a spin! 
</p>
