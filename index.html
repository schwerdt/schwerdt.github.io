</p> Hello!  I am starting this page with my Prairie Fest Medallion Hunting code.  I am not yet sure
what will be next!  The code can be found in the PrairieFestMedallionHunt repository.

</p> I was reading about search and decided to test out some different measures of similarity
by writing a very simple search code.  There is a README file in this repository:
<br/>
<A HREF="https://github.com/schwerdt/TakingSearchForASpin">https://github.com/schwerdt/TakingSearchForASpin</A>
<br/>
that has information about how to run it and add articles to the set of articles that is searched. 
I plan to work on improving the search method and the sources that are searched but wanted to 
share what I have so far!  Hope you have fun if you decide to take this search method for a spin!
